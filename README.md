ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m @GrantFolkert, formerly an undergraduate at Central Michigan University in the Bioluminescent Optogenetics Lab, now a graduate student at Brown University.

ðŸ‘€ Interests: in vivo electrophysiology to study cortical sensory processing, in addition to "the weird, arcane sh*t" (not my description).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking the deep dive into spectral analysis with local field potential data from the mouse PFC and barrel cortex.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: grant_folkert@brown.edu
