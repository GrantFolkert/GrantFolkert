ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m @GrantFolkert, an undergraduate student of neuroscience and philosophy at Central Michigan University.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in broad applications of machine learning to tasks in neuroscience research, computational modeleling, and how logical operations are performed in the brain. 
On the philosophy side I am interested in logical positivism, truth semantics, the foundations of logic, and decision theory.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to collect and process in-vivo electrophysiology data. In the future, I would like to learn patch clamp techniques.
