ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m @GrantFolkert, an undergraduate student of neuroscience and philosophy at Central Michigan University.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many, many things. The programming/methods-related ones broadly include spectral analysis, single-unit analysis, and computational neuroethology.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently taking the deep dive into spectral analysis with local field potential data from the mouse PFC and barrel cortex.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: folke1g@cmich.edu
